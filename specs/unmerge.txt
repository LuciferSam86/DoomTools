WADUNMERGE
==========

Explodes a WAD into a directory tree that can be merged back together.
Un-merges WAD contents into data, and writes WADMerge scripts for it.
If data is readable as-is (PNG/GIF/PCX/BMP/TGA/DDS/KVX/VOX/WAV/OGG/MP3/SPC/IT/S3M/XM/MOD/MUS/MID/TXT/O/LMP),
the corresponding extension is used for it.
